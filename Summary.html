<p>Trevor Noah tells stories about his childhood, and in telling thestory.<br>
   he gives insight into his country’s history, culture, and traditions.<br>
   Trevor's mother was one of the devout Christians who took herfamily<br>
   to church.Every Sunday where they attended different churchesevery <br>
   Sunday.she believed that different churches offered differentthings.<br>
   Trevour enjoyed attending churches even though hated the process of<br>
   commuting.To churches especially when their secondhand car was not<br>
   working.Where they had to use minibuses which was a very complex <br>
   means of transport.I relate to this because as I was growing up I<br> 
   loved going to church.But anytime started raining I would look for<br>
   all excuses not to attend.Trevor was thrown out of a moving bus to<br>
   protect him and her mother jumped.After him but Trevor was bleeding<br>
   on confused and he didn’t know what was happening.I relate to this<br>
   most of my parents including my own would  to ensure we are safe.<br>
<br>
<br>      
  The second chapter shows how Trevor grew up during apartheid which<br>
  was weird because, he was raised in a mixed family where hfather<br>
  was a white Swiss man and his mother was black.During this time <br>
  Trevor's existence was against the law therefore it was hard for<br>
  both Trevor's parents to be seen together with   their     son.<br>
  In relation to our county people from different tribes that are<br> 
  not from this our tribe especially males are viewed as workers<br>
  such as Shamba boys or for ladies are viewed as Nany’s or House<br>
  managers.</p>
