<p>Trevor Noah tells stories about his childhood, and in telling the story.<br>
he gives insight into his country’s history, culture, and traditions.<br>
Trevor's mother was one of the devout Christians who took her family to church.<br> 
Every Sunday where they attended different churches every Sunday.<br>
she believed that different churches offered different things.<br>
<br>
Trevour enjoyed attending churches even though hated the process of commuting.<br>
To churches especially when their secondhand car was not working.<br>
Where they had to use minibuses which was a very complex means of transport.<br>
I relate to this because as I was growing up I loved going to church.
<br>
But anytime started raining I would look for all excuses not to attend.<br>
Trevor was thrown out of a moving bus to protect him and her mother jumped.<br>
After him but Trevor was bleeding on confused and he didn’t know what was happening.<br>
I relate to this most of my parents including my own would go to any extent to ensure we are safe.
<br>

The second chapter shows how Trevor grew up during apartheid which was weird because,<br> 
he was raised in a mixed family where his father was a white Swiss man and<br>
his mother was black.During this time Trevor's existence was against the law therefore<br>
it was hard for both Trevor's parents to be seen together with their son. <br>
In relation to our county people from different tribes that are not from this<br> 
our tribe especially males are viewed as workers such as Shamba boys or for ladies<br>
are viewed as Nany’s or House managers.</p>
